    "\n",
    "Magic numbers are **constants** which are written into code as **literals**, making it very difficult to understand what their purpose is. An example could be a threshold such as a pass mark: if written as `if mark > 0.5:` the meaning of `0.5` is obscured, just like using a bad variable name. Instead, we should store these values as **global variables** named with capital letters at the top of our program: `PASS_MARK = 0.5` and then refer to that variable where necessary in the code: `if mark > PASS_MARK:`\n",
    "\n",
    "The **all-capital** letters indicate that the variable is actually a **constant**, and our code will **never change its value** (using global variables in other contexts is bad style). This makes our code much more **readable and easy to maintain** because we can see where we are using a constant value by the capital letters and understand what it represents. We can also edit the value of a constant easily at the top of our program and that change applied to every place that constant is used in our program.\n",

    "### 6.  What is a “namespace”?\n",
    "\n",
    "A namespace is a mapping from names (of variables or functions) to objects. It defines the collection of variables which can be used in a certain part of your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. What do we mean by “local” and “global” namespace? What is “scope”?\n",
    "\n",
    "![namespace.png](attachment:namespace.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **global namespace** is the collection of variables and functions available outside of any functions in a program. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a function is called, it will have a **local namespace** which is unique to that function’s execution and forgotten once it returns. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When a variable is referred to, Python looks in the most local namespace first, and if it can’t be found there, proceeds to check the global namespace. This means a function can use its local variables and global variables **BUT NOT** variables defined in another function. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is also the subtlety that variables not in the local namespace may not be edited without declaring that you intend to do so. We discourage the editing of global variables from inside a function because it is safer to return values from your function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Scope is the area of a program where a particular namespace is used. Variables in a function’s local namespace are said to be in the function’s scope.\n",
    "Note that a function defined in another (while a strange thing to do) will be able to read the variables in the outer function, given they’re not “overshadowed” by variables with the same name in the inner function. Think of it like a venn diagram - if a function is inside another, it can access anything directly outside it. Any function can therefore access the global namespace.\n",

    "### 8. When is it useful to “return early”? How can it make our code safer and more efficient?\n",
    "\n",
    "**returning early** is where during a long-running computation the answer is returned as soon as it is known rather than waiting for the process to complete. \n",
    "\n",
    "- When to use?\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s often used in the case where a sequence of values is iterated through and a test applied to each one. If we’re looking to find whether one value fulfils the test, we can return a True result as soon as we find a single such value: There’s no need to continue testing the rest of the values as nothing will change the output from being True. This increases the efficiency of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "This principle is also used in a concept called “short circuiting” in boolean tests where a result is returned as soon as it is known based on the rules of `and` and `or`.For example, `if num != 0 and 4/num == 2:` would never cause an error as a false first statement (where `num = 0`) would cause a `False` response to be sent immediately without needing to execute the division by zero which would cause a `ZeroDivisionError`. This can make code safer.\n",

    "\n",
    "A helper function is a function that performs some part of the computation of another function. Helper functions can make programs more readable by giving descriptive names to computations. By taking computations out of a function and placing them in helper functions, we can then reuse those helper functions if we ever need that computation again. This is much easier than selectively cutting out parts of a larger function."
