    "### 1. What is a “list comprehension”? How do we write one and how do they make our code simpler?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **list comprehension** is a shortcut notation used to accomplish simple iteration tasks involving a collection (usually list, but also possibly a set or dictionary) in one line of code. List comprehensions are formed by wrapping a pair of brackets around `<expression> <for iteration statement> <optional if filter condition>`. The iteration statement will be run and for each iteration, the result of the expression will be added to the collection - which could be a list, set or dictionary. If a filter condition is included, the object will only be added if that condition evaluates to True.\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions are useful to shorten repetitive, simple loops into readable single lines of code. They are especially useful for **initialising lists**. Avoid cramming too much into list comprehensions or nesting them inside each other: we want them to remain readable.\n",

    "\n",
    "In Python, to open a file we use the `open()` function, which takes two arguments: the file’s `filename` as a string; and another string which represents the `“mode”` for access.
