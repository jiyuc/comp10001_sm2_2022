    "*HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)* is a markup language (not a programming language like Python) used to take a document composed of text and other media (images, video, hyperlinks...) and communicate how it is to be rendered for *display*. It is used extensively on the web: an internet browser displays a webpage by downloading and presenting the website’s HTML."

Programming is simply learning how to write code: how to use correct grammar and structure when writing in a programming language so that a computer can understand what we intend to communicate.

    "### 8. Identify the following as belonging to the exact or approximate approaches to algorithms, and discuss how they approach solving problems with some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>:Brute-Force (Generate and Test):</b> exact approach. Finds the solution by enumerating <b>every possible answer and testing them one-by-one</b>. This requires answers to be within a calculable range that allows the program to run to completion: if there are billions of options, it may take years to do this, rendering a brute-force approach useless to that problem. Examples include Linear search and Problem 2 of this tutorial sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>:Heuristic Search:</b> approximate approach. Finds a solution by using a more efficient approximate method than one which is completely correct. <b>The answer may not be optimal but is often “close enough” especially when the alternative is a significantly slower algorithm.</b> Examples include finding the closest distance or shortest path to a destination: finding the definitive solution would require processing many possibilities but by looking at the most likely solutions, we can find a rough answer in much less time.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>:Simulation:</b> approximate approach. Finds a solution by generating a lot of data to predict an overall trend. One example is simulating the play of a game of chance to test whether it’s worth playing. Many rounds of results can be generated and combined to find whether, on average, money was won or lost. In the real world, the outcome may be different, but by running simulations we can find the most likely outcome. Other examples include modelling movement of objects by using physics formulas and the prediction of weather patterns by running simulations of climate models based on past observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>:Divide and Conquer:</b> exact approach. Finds a solution by dividing the problem into a set of smaller sub-problems which can be more easily solved, then combining the solutions of those sub-problems to find the answer of the overall problem. Examples include binary search and many sorting algorithms. The idea behind Divide and Conquer based sorting algorithms is that they may, for example, sort each half of a list separately before combining them, leading to a faster solution than sorting the whole list at once."
